Author: Eric Cortez
Class: CS55.13
Instructor: Ethan Wilde

Requirements:
Using JavaScript code, create a simple web server application that generates at least
three different unique static text responses to at least three different HTTP requests
that it receives. Manage your application's code using a GitHub repository and Visual
Studio Codeâ€™s git integration.

Assignment Description Summary:
1) Write JavaScript code for a simple web server application using the index.js
file in your project, saving it when done.

2) Try running your server-side JavaScript by opening a terminal inside of
Visual Studio Code and issuing the following command at the terminal prompt: node index.js

3) Push code to your GitHub repository when done.
